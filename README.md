# Editor Zoom

This tiny Visual Studio Code plugin allows you to zoom the editor font in and out using `Cmd+8` and `Cmd+9` (Ctrl on Win/Linux).

The built-in zoom mechanism zoom the entire window, which is not always desirable.

The editor zoom updates editor.fontSize in `settings.json` and is thus persistent.

## Contributing

Go to github.com/zolo/editorzoom to contribute patches and report issues.

Suggestions:

* Make the font size change configurable (currently +/- 2 points)

* Test on Windows/Linux, make necessary fixes (keymappings)
